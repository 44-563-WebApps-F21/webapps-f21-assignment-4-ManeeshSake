                    THEATRE ROYAL, HAYMARKET
                </h2>
                <p class= "stage-direction">
                    The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.

                    [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
                    the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
                    _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
                    up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
                    lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
                    tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
                    Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.

                <h6 class="ladybasildon name">LADY BASILDON</h6> <p class="speech">[_Emphatically_.]  Yes, always to others, have we not?</p> 

                <h6 class="lordgoring name">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">[_Smiling_.]  And those are the views of the two ladies who
                 are known to have the most admirable husbands in London</p>  

                 <h6 class="marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="speech">That is exactly what we can’t stand.  My Reginald is
                 quite hopelessly faultless.  He is really unendurably so, at times!
                 There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him.</p>  

                <h6 class="lordgoring name">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">How terrible!  Really, the thing should be more widely
                    known!
                        </p> 


             <h6 class="ladybasildon name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="speech"> Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was
             a bachelor.
             </p>
             <h6 class="marchmort name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>  <p class="speech">[_Pressing_ LADY BASILDON’S _hand_.]  My poor Olivia!
                We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.
                </p>
                <h6 class="lordgoring name">LORD GORING</h6>  <p class="speech">I should have thought it was the husbands who were
                    punished.</p>

                    <h6 class="marchmort name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6> <p class="speech">[_Drawing herself up_.]  Oh, dear no!  They are as happy
                        as possible!  And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust
                        us.</p> 

                        <h6 class="ladybasildon name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="speech">Perfectly tragic!</p>
