        THEATRE ROYAL, HAYMARKET
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.

        [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
        up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.

    <p>
        MRS. MARCHMONT. I come here to be educated.
        <br>

        LADY BASILDON. Ah! I hate being educated!
        <br>
    
        MRS. MARCHMONT. So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
        here to try to find one.
        <br>
    
        LADY BASILDON. [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] I don’t see
        anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.
        <br>
    
        MRS. MARCHMONT. How very trivial of him!
        <br>
    
        LADY BASILDON. Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?
        <br>
    
        MRS. MARCHMONT. About myself.
        <br>
    
        LADY BASILDON. [_Languidly_.] And were you interested?
        <br>
    
        MRS. MARCHMONT. [_Shaking her head_.] Not in the smallest degree.
        <br>
    
        LADY BASILDON. What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!
