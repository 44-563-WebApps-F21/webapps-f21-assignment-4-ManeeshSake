        THEATRE ROYAL, HAYMARKET
    </h2>
    <p class= "stage-direction">
        The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.

        [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
        up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.

        <h6 class="marchmort name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6> <p class="speech"> So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
        here to try to find one.</p>
        <br>
    
        <h6 class="lady basildon name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="speech">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] I don’t see
            anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
            The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
            time.
