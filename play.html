        THEATRE ROYAL, HAYMARKET

    <p class= "stage-direction">
        The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.

        [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
        up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.
